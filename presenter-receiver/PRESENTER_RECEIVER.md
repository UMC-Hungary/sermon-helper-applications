# Presenter Receiver

A standalone binary that connects to the Sermon Helper server over WebSocket and renders presentation slides directly on a display — no browser required. Designed for Raspberry Pi running Raspberry Pi OS Lite (Linux framebuffer) or as a secondary window on macOS.

## How it works

The binary runs as a single process with two concurrent parts:

**WebSocket thread** — connects to the Sermon Helper server, sends a registration message, and listens for slide state updates. When a new slide or state arrives it renders the slide to a pixel frame and sends it to the display thread via a channel. Reconnects automatically every 3 seconds on disconnect.

**Display thread** — owns the output device and polls the channel for new frames every 100 ms. On Linux it writes pixel data directly to `/dev/fb0` (the kernel framebuffer). On macOS it drives a `minifb` window. The display thread also reads the current connection state and composites a status indicator into the top-right corner of every frame before writing to the output.

**Rendering** — slides are rendered with Cairo and Pango. White bold text (Helvetica Neue) is vertically centred on a dark background (`#0D0D14`). Font size is determined by binary search to fit all paragraphs within 80 % of the frame height. A thin accent line is drawn at the top.

**Status indicator** — a small pill in the top-right corner of the display shows the connection state at all times:

| Indicator | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Filled green dot + version | Connected to the server |
| Filled orange dot | Connecting or reconnecting |
| Filled red dot | 5 or more consecutive connection failures |

**Picture mute** — when the server sets the muted state the binary renders a plain black frame instead of slide content. The status indicator remains visible.

## Installation

### One-line installer (recommended)

The installer script auto-detects the platform, installs required system libraries (Linux only), downloads the correct binary from the latest GitHub release, and places it in `/usr/local/bin`.

**Install only:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UMC-Hungary/sermon-helper-applications/main/presenter-receiver/install.sh | bash
```

**Install and start immediately:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UMC-Hungary/sermon-helper-applications/main/presenter-receiver/install.sh | bash -s -- ws://YOUR_SERVER_IP:3737/ws
```

**Install with auto-start on boot** (Linux / systemd only):
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UMC-Hungary/sermon-helper-applications/main/presenter-receiver/install.sh | bash -s -- ws://YOUR_SERVER_IP:3737/ws --service
```

The install command is also available pre-filled with your server's address on the **Connect** page of the Tauri application.

### What the installer does

1. Detects OS and CPU architecture.
2. On Linux with `apt`: checks for and installs missing shared libraries (`libcairo2`, `libcairo-gobject2`, `libpango-1.0-0`, `libpangocairo-1.0-0`, `libpangoft2-1.0-0`, `libglib2.0-0`).
3. Downloads the matching binary from the latest GitHub release.
4. Installs the binary to `/usr/local/bin/presenter-receiver` (falls back to the current directory if sudo is unavailable).
5. If `--service` is passed:
   - Removes any previously installed background service.
   - Configures getty auto-login on TTY1 so the console logs in automatically on boot (no login prompt).
   - Creates `~/.local/log/` and writes a restart loop to `~/.bash_profile` that redirects all output to `~/.local/log/presenter-receiver.log`.
   - Writes `/etc/sysctl.d/99-presenter-console.conf` with `kernel.printk = 1 4 1 3` to prevent kernel messages (undervoltage warnings, hwmon events, etc.) from overwriting the framebuffer display.
   - Restarts the getty service so the change takes effect immediately.

### Manual download

```bash
# Replace BINARY with the correct name for your platform (see table above)
curl -fsSL https://github.com/UMC-Hungary/sermon-helper-applications/releases/latest/download/BINARY -o presenter-receiver
chmod +x presenter-receiver
./presenter-receiver ws://YOUR_SERVER_IP:3737/ws
```

---

## Connecting to the server

### Basic usage

```bash
presenter-receiver ws://192.168.1.10:3737/ws
```

### With authentication token

If the Sermon Helper server requires a token (recommended for production), pass it via `--token`:

```bash
presenter-receiver ws://192.168.1.10:3737/ws --token YOUR_TOKEN
```

The token is shown on the **Connect** page of the Tauri application under **Auth Token**.

### Finding your server address

Open the Sermon Helper desktop app and go to **Connect**. The **Network URL** field shows the address other devices on the same network should use. Copy it and replace `http://` with `ws://`, then append `/ws`:

```
http://192.168.1.10:3737  ->  ws://192.168.1.10:3737/ws
```

---

## Viewing logs

When installed with `--service`, all output is written to:

```
~/.local/log/presenter-receiver.log
```

To stream logs live from another machine:

```bash
ssh pi@raspberrypi
tail -f ~/.local/log/presenter-receiver.log
```

The **Connect** page of the Tauri app has an SSH Access section that generates the SSH command for any saved device and provides the log tail command ready to copy.

---

## Updating

Re-run the same install command used during the original installation. The script always downloads the latest release and overwrites the existing binary. If `--service` was used originally, include it again — the script is idempotent and will update the WebSocket URL in `~/.bash_profile` as well.

After the script completes, reboot the device (or kill the running process — the restart loop will start the new binary within 3 seconds).

---

## Required WebSocket message format

The presenter receiver speaks a subset of the Sermon Helper WebSocket protocol. All messages are JSON text frames.

### Messages sent by the receiver (client to server)

**Registration** — sent immediately after the WebSocket handshake:

```json
{
  "type": "presenter.register",
  "label": "Presenter Receiver",
  "hostname": "raspberrypi"
}
```

`hostname` is obtained by running the system `hostname` command. It is `null` if the command fails.

**State request** — sent immediately after registration to receive the current presenter state:

```json
{ "type": "presenter.status" }
```

**Ping reply** — sent in response to every `ping` message from the server:

```json
{ "type": "pong", "ping_id": 42 }
```

`ping_id` must be the integer value received in the `ping` message.

---

### Messages consumed by the receiver (server to client)

The receiver ignores all message types it does not recognise. Unknown types do not cause an error or disconnection.

**Full presenter state** — sent by the server on load, unload, slide change, and mute toggle. Replaces the entire local state:

```json
{
  "type": "presenter.state",
  "state": {
    "loaded": true,
    "filePath": "/path/to/file.pptx",
    "currentSlide": 2,
    "totalSlides": 10,
    "muted": false,
    "slides": [
      {
        "index": 1,
        "paragraphs": [
          { "text": "Title line", "align": "center" },
          { "text": "Subtitle", "align": "center" }
        ]
      },
      {
        "index": 2,
        "paragraphs": [
          { "text": "Second slide", "align": "left" }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Field notes:
- `loaded` — when `false`, all other fields are at their zero values and the receiver shows a black screen.
- `currentSlide` — 1-based index into `slides`. `0` means no slide is active.
- `muted` — when `true`, the receiver renders a black frame regardless of `currentSlide`.
- `slides` — full array of all slides including their text content. Only the slide at `currentSlide` is rendered.
- `paragraphs[].align` — one of `"left"`, `"center"`, `"right"`, `"justify"`. The receiver maps these to Pango alignment values.
- `paragraphs[].text` — plain text. Hard line breaks within a paragraph are represented as `\n` characters.

**Incremental slide update** — sent when only the active slide number changes (navigation). The receiver updates `currentSlide` and re-renders without replacing the slide content array:

```json
{
  "type": "presenter.slide_changed",
  "currentSlide": 3,
  "totalSlides": 10
}
```

`totalSlides` is present for informational use; the receiver does not use it for rendering.

**Ping** — sent by the server as a keepalive. The receiver must reply with `pong`:

```json
{ "type": "ping", "pingId": 42 }
```

### Implementing a compatible server

A server is compatible with the receiver if it:

1. Accepts a WebSocket connection at any path (the receiver connects to whatever URL is passed on the command line).
2. Sends `presenter.state` on connection (in response to `presenter.status`) and whenever state changes.
3. Sends `presenter.slide_changed` on navigation.
4. Sends periodic `ping` messages and expects `pong` replies.
5. Accepts `presenter.register` for informational purposes (the receiver sends it but does not require a response).

The `slides` array must be complete in every `presenter.state` message — partial updates are not supported. If `loaded` is `false`, the `slides` array should be empty and `currentSlide` should be `0`.
